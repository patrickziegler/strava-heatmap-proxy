# strava-heatmap-proxy

This software allows streaming high resolution [Strava Global Heatmap](https://www.strava.com/maps/global-heatmap) tiles with clients like [QGIS](https://qgis.org/de/site/), [QMapShack](https://github.com/Maproom/qmapshack/wiki), [JOSM](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/) and many others without requiring them to be able to handle the Strava specific authentication and session management.

You can use the software either as [static file configurator](#using-the-static-file-configurator) or as [proxy server](#using-the-reverse-proxy) that handles the authentication on the fly.

## Getting started

### :hammer: Build and Install

With [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [golang](https://go.dev/) and [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) available on your system, the following steps are sufficient to build and install the binaries `strava-heatmap-auth` and `strava-heatmap-proxy` to the given path `INSTALL_PREFIX`

```sh
git clone https://github.com/patrickziegler/strava-heatmap-proxy
cd strava-heatmap-proxy
INSTALL_PREFIX=~/.local/bin make
```

### :wrench: Configuration

The tools expect a config file located in `~/.config/strava-heatmap-proxy/config.json` containing [Strava](https://www.strava.com/) login credentials like shown below.
The option `--config <path>` can be used to specify a custom location.

```json
{
  "Email": "...",
  "Password": "..."
}
```

### :broken_heart: Direct login broken

Please note that the direct login method to Strava does not work anymore (as described in https://github.com/patrickziegler/strava-heatmap-proxy/issues/3).
Running the tools without any further parameters will give you `failed with status code 403 Forbidden`.

As a workaround, I have implemented the option `--client firefox` (available with both tools described below) to read the newest CloudFront tokens from your Firefox cookie database instead.
For this to work, you'll need to login to Strava and open the [Global Heatmap](https://www.strava.com/maps/global-heatmap) once before running the commands below.

## Using the static file configurator

The tool `strava-heatmap-auth` will read from `stdin`, replace all occurences of `%CloudFront-Key-Pair-Id%`, `%CloudFront-Policy%` and `%CloudFront-Signature%` tokens with the values retrieved as authentication cookie and write the result to `stdout`.

This design allows us to provide a template [TMS](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/TMS) file like the following:

```xml
<TMS>
  <Title>StravaHeatmap</Title>
  <MinZoomLevel>3</MinZoomLevel>
  <MaxZoomLevel>11</MaxZoomLevel>
  <Layer idx="0">
    <ServerUrl>https://heatmap-external-a.strava.com/tiles-auth/all/bluered/%1/%2/%3.png?v=19&amp;Key-Pair-Id=%CloudFront-Key-Pair-Id%&amp;Policy=%CloudFront-Policy%&amp;Signature=%CloudFront-Signature%</ServerUrl>
  </Layer>
</TMS>
```

And create the actual file with all `%CloudFront-*%` tokens replaced by their correct values with the following [pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)):

```sh
cat StravaHeatmapAuth.tms.in | strava-heatmap-auth --config <path> | tee StravaHeatmapAuth.tms
```

Be aware that those parameters may expire after some time (about a week) and you will need to manually re-create the file with the command above.

## Using the reverse proxy

The tool `strava-heatmap-proxy` will set up a local proxy server for `https://heatmap-external-a.strava.com/`.
Every request to `http://localhost:8080/` (or a different port that you can configure via `--port`) will then be extended with session cookies before being forwarded to Strava.

This design allows us to use a simple [TMS](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/TMS) file like shown below for fetching high resolution heatmap tiles:

```xml
<TMS>
  <Title>StravaHeatmap</Title>
  <MinZoomLevel>3</MinZoomLevel>
  <MaxZoomLevel>11</MaxZoomLevel>
  <Layer idx="0">
    <ServerUrl>http://localhost:8080/tiles-auth/all/bluered/%1/%2/%3.png</ServerUrl>
  </Layer>
</TMS>
```
