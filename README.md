# strava-heatmap-proxy

This software allows streaming high resolution [Strava Global Heatmap](https://www.strava.com/maps/global-heatmap) tiles with clients like [QGIS](https://qgis.org/de/site/), [QMapShack](https://github.com/Maproom/qmapshack/wiki), [JOSM](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/) and many others without requiring them to be able to handle the Strava specific authentication and session management.

To do so, you need:
1. The [strava-cookie-exporter](strava-cookie-exporter.xpi) browser extension to export the necessary cookies as json file
1. The [strava-heatmap-proxy](#using-the-proxy-server) server which adds the necessary cookies to your requests before redirecting them to Strava

## Getting started

### :hammer: Build and Install

With [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [golang](https://go.dev/) and [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) available on your system, the following steps are sufficient to build and install `strava-heatmap-proxy` to the given path `INSTALL_PREFIX`

```sh
git clone https://github.com/patrickziegler/strava-heatmap-proxy
cd strava-heatmap-proxy
INSTALL_PREFIX=~/.local/bin make install
```

### :jigsaw: Using the browser extension

Previous [versions](https://github.com/patrickziegler/strava-heatmap-proxy/tree/v1) of this repository allowed to login and extract the necessary cookies automatically.
Due to recent changes on Strava side this is not possible anymore and we need to extract the cookies in a different way.
For this purpose, we have developed the browser extension `strava-cookie-exporter` which can be used to download a json file with the necessary cookies to feed the [proxy server](#using-the-proxy-server) with.

You can download the extension for Firefox [here](strava-cookie-exporter.xpi) and install it manually in the Firefox add-on management.

With this extension installed, you can
- use your browser to login and navigate to the [Strava Global Heatmap](https://www.strava.com/maps/global-heatmap)
- use the `strava-cookie-exporter` extension to export the relevant cookies as json file

### :arrows_counterclockwise: Using the proxy server

Running the tool `strava-heatmap-proxy` from your terminal will set up a local proxy server for `https://content-a.strava.com/`.
Every request to `http://localhost:8080/` will then be extended with session cookies before being forwarded to Strava.
You can configure different target URLs or port numbers via `--target` or `--port` as well.

By default, the necessary cookies are expected to be found in the file `${HOME}/.config/strava-heatmap-proxy/strava-cookies.json` (should be manually created with the `strava-cookie-exporter` extension).
You can configure different locations of that file via `--cookies` as well.

To use this with your GIS software of choice, just define a simple [TMS](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/TMS) layer like shown below that fetches high resolution heatmap tiles:

```xml
<TMS>
  <Title>StravaGlobalHeatmap</Title>
  <MinZoomLevel>3</MinZoomLevel>
  <MaxZoomLevel>11</MaxZoomLevel>
  <Layer idx="0">
    <ServerUrl>http://localhost:8080/identified/globalheat/all/bluered/%1/%2/%3.png?v=19</ServerUrl>
  </Layer>
</TMS>
```
